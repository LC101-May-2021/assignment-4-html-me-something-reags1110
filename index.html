      <h2> When I imagine traveling anywhere in this world, the options are endless.  How can you possibly choose? Whether it be basking in the sun on a beach, or
         hiking a mountain on the other side of the world, I've come up with my own, shall we say "Bucket List" of places that I intend to experience. There are way too
         many to list here, but I came up with my top four<strong> so</strong>, without further ado, these are some of my dream destinations that I haven't been to...yet!</h2>

         <p>If I had to choose just one destination on this list, it would be <strong> Venice </strong>. I fell in love with
            this transcendent city long ago and, as I
            grew older, have dreamt of sitting in a gondola floating on the Grand Canal just letting the world go by. There’s
            something extremely romantic about Venice that makes you want to experience
            it with the one you love. I so want my husband and I to go there, emmerse ourselves in this magnificent city, and
            then relax with a Bellini <em>(created at the world famous Harry's Bar!)</em> and just enjoy life like only
            Venetians can. Just imagine strolling down alleyways, eating authentic gelato while window shopping for Italian
            leather handbags (or <strong> shoes</strong>!!). Whether it’s the historic Basilica located in the heart
            of the Piazza San Marco, the Rialto Bridge, or the Ponte dei Sospiri, there is so much history to be seen on this
            magical little island, and I want to experience it all.

         <p>Paris, France...honestly, are those the most romantic words you've ever heard? I've always wanted to see what draws people to this magnificent "City of Lights" and experience, first hand, the vastness of 
         culture and history that only Paris offers. Although most travel here for the sites and sounds (and rightly so), my reasons would be a little different with this one; it's the <strong>food</strong>!! I'm serious. The French, hands down in my
         opinion, are the <em>crème de la crème</em>(see what I did there?) when it comes to cuisine. I want to sit in a Parisian cafe, sipping on a cafè au lait and nibbling on a croissant. To walk hand in hand with my husband
         to a pâtisserie and decide on which eclair to devour, or to buy a baguette from a vendor, stroll along the Left Bank and just...breath. And, let's be honest, if the Eiffel Tower is in the background with all of
         this, that would be absolutely majestic all on it's own.

         <p>From the incredible beaches, to the majestic waterfalls, Hawaii has a little bit of everything that you need for an epic tropical vacation.  This is a place that comes to mind when somebody asks 
         me "Where would you go to lay on a beach and chill?". I mean does it get any better than Hawaii? I want to visit Maui the most because of the waterfalls. <strong>WOW</strong> are they stunning! My ideal Hawaiian
         getaway would have to include just lying on the beach, listening to the waves, sipping on a Mai Tai and doing absolutely nothing. Heavenly, right? My thoughts exactly. Aloha!

      <p>I've heard you feel small in Alaska because of how open it is. Just to experience that, in itself, would be incredible. To be able to witness the astounding scenery that Alaska 
         offers us, whether it be the mountains or fishing, would just be a dream. I know it'll be cold, and I'm working through that, but I think it'll be worth it when I'm looking up at 
         the Northern Lights after whale watching all day and just being in <strong> awe </strong> of everything. Also added bonus: Crab and Salmon. To be able to have those freshly caught with that
         scenery around me while I indulge on life? That's a no brainer.
